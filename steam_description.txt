[h1]Stellaris List EXtender [/h1]
This mod is a utility mod. It adds functions to allow modders to use lists of variables or event_targets and to sort them. Using lists as piles (First In, Last Out) is also possible.
It also allows modders to get the value of a trigger condition (such as income, or amount of minerals in the reserve) stored into a variable.
All of this is time and memory-wise efficient. Performance benchmark is included.

Please see https://github.com/calniotrey/stellaris-list-extender for more informations.

[h2]For players[/h2]
This is a modders resources mod. That means you should only download this if other mods have this as a dependancy. Having this mod as standalone won't do anything (content wise).

Just activate this mod and put anywhere in your mod order. This mod has no requirements and no compatibility issues.
Please take in mind this mod changes checksum and desactivate achievements (but the mods that need this mod do the same as well).

[h2]For modders[/h2]
Please look at the link of the github repository above. You will find full documentation as well as some examples. If you have some questions/issues, feel free to contact me via the Stellaris Modding Den (I'm Erdnuss).
Do not include this mod in your mods. Instead, put this mod as a dependancy (via Steam or just with a link). If you plan to release a non-steam version, please contact me so that I can create a download link in the github repository.
